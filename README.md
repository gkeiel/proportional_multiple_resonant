# proportional_multiple_resonant

A code to compute proportional_multiple_resonant (PMR) controller and current feedback gain in order to ensure UPSs stability and performance. PMR and current gains tunned by means of LMI approach with pole placement constraints. Minor modifications can be made to deal with robustness problem and more advanced performance restrictions.
